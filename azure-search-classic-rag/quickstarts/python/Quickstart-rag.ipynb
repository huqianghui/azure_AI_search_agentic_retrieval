    "# Quickstart: Classic RAG in Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickstart provides a query for RAG scenarios. It's based on the [classic RAG pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-agentic-retrieval-concept) in Azure AI Search. This pattern uses a chat completion model to provide a response to a query posed to your content on Azure AI Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a few shortcuts to keep the exercise basic and focused on query definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the [**hotels-sample-index**](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal), which is created in other quickstarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We omit vectors so that we can skip chunking and embedding. The index contains plain text. A non-vector index isn't ideal for RAG patterns, but it makes for a simpler example."
