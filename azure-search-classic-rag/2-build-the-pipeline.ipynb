    "Learn how to build an automated indexing pipeline for a RAG solution on Azure AI Search. Indexing automation is through an indexer that drives indexing and skillset execution, providing integrated data chunking and vectorization on a one-time or recurring basis for incremental updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with Azure AI Search indexing, there's nothing about the indexer-driven pipeline in these exercises that's specific to RAG. What's important is that the source content is informative and richly descriptive, which lends itself to question and answer exchanges that are typical of RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline creates chunked and vectorized content so that your queries can target both vector and non-vector content. Hybrid search using both queries often produces more relevant results than just keyword or vector search alone."
